# Chirper-App

The Chirper App implements a pre-alpha version of an app called Chirper – a microblogging interactive system. Users may post chirps, scroll through their friend’s chirps, rechirp and like posts. The program will be implemented using doubly-linked lists.

App Features:
The Chirper app is a microblogging software system that allows a user to post and interact with short messages called chirps. Chirps may span up to 180 characters maximum. User’s can “like” their own posts, or a friend’s post. They may also re-chirp a friend’s post. A re-chirp implies that the content of the friend’s chirp post (message text) is copied as a chirp to the user’s account. For the pre-alpha version, the Chirper app can sustain the user’s account, and a maximum of one friend.
